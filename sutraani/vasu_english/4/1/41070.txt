This aphorism applies, when no comparison is intended. As संहितोरूः 'a female whose thighs are joined (e.g. from obesity)' शफोरूः 'whose thighs are put together like the two hoofs on a cow's foot,' लक्षणोरूः 'whose thighs are marked,' वामोरूः 'with handsome thighs.'

Vart:- So also with the words सहित and सह. As सहितोरूः and सहोरूः ॥
